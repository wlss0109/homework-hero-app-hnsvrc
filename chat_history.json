Initially, this could be a placeholder, and later integrated with an actual problem-solving engine.\n-   **User Profile:** A basic profile screen where users can track their solved questions or save questions for later.\n\n**Design Elements:**\n\n-   **Colors:**\n    -   Background: `#F5F5DC` (Beige)\n    -   Text: `#2E294E` (Dark Indigo)\n    -   TextSecondary: `#6E798C` (Grayish Blue)\n    -   Primary: `#6C63FF` (Bright Purple)\n    -   Secondary: `#F72585` (Vivid Pink)\n    -   Accent: `#4CC9F0` (Vibrant Cyan)\n    -   Card: `#FFFFFF` (White)\n    -   Highlight: `#FFF59D` (Pale Yellow)\n-   **Typography:** Use modern, clean fonts like \"System\" for a native feel.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Modify `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx`:**\n    -   Change the existing content to include a prominent button or input field for users to enter their homework questions.\n    -   Add navigation to a new screen where the solution will be displayed.\n\n2.  **Create a new screen for question input and solution display:**\n    -   Create a new file, `app/solution.tsx`, to handle question input and display the solution.\n    -   Include a text input field for typing questions and a button to submit the question.\n    -   For now, display a placeholder solution.\n\n3.  **Modify `app/(tabs)/profile.tsx`:**\n    -   Add a section to display the user's solved questions or saved questions. This can be a simple list for the first version.\n\n4.  **Modify `app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx`:**\n    -   Ensure that the tab bar includes an icon for the profile screen.\n\n5.  **Remove modal demos:**\n    -   Remove the `modalDemos` array from `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx` as it is not needed for the study app.\n\nNow, I will instruct the coding agent to implement the plan.\n\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-10-02T10:08:49.350954"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you create a study app that can solve homework questions.
